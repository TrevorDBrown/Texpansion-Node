# Texpansion
A text expanding utility for macOS, Windows, and Linux.

## Prerequisites
Texpansion requires Node.js to run.
 
## Installation
Coming soon...

## Support
As on 3/6/2018, Texpansion has been tested in macOS. It is assumed that Windows and Linux work as well, but I can't verify this until I've tested them.

## Node packages
Texpansion uses the following npm packages:
- [Robot.js](https://github.com/octalmage/robotjs)
  - Allows for the replacement of text.
- [iohook](https://github.com/WilixLead/iohook) 
  - Allows for the interpretation of keystrokes.

## Additional Notes
I'm currently working on a version using Electron, among other things.

## Thanks
I'd like to thank the developers of Robot.js and iohook for developing those respective packages. If not for them, this project would not have been as easy to make.
